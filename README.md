# Snake Game with Reinforcement Learning

This project demonstrates the use of **Reinforcement Learning** and **Deep Q-Learning** to play the classic game of Snake. The snake starts by navigating randomly but gradually learns to play the game more effectively, eventually identifying and eating the food placed on the grid with increased efficiency.

## Features
- Implements **Deep Q-Learning** to train the snake.
- Python-based implementation.
- Modular code structure with four main components.

## File Descriptions
- **agent.py**: The core logic for training the reinforcement learning agent. This file also starts the Snake game.
- **game.py**: Contains the game environment logic, including the rules and mechanics of the Snake game.
- **helper.py**: Provides utility functions to support the training process and game logic.
- **model.py**: Defines the deep learning model architecture used by the agent.

## How It Works
1. **Random Navigation**: At the beginning, the snake moves randomly, exploring the environment.
2. **Learning Phase**: Through experience and the Deep Q-Learning algorithm, the agent learns to associate specific actions with higher rewards (e.g., moving towards food while avoiding collisions).
3. **Improved Gameplay**: Over time, the snake becomes proficient at locating and eating the food while avoiding obstacles, improving its performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `tensorflow` or `pytorch` (depending on the library used in `model.py`)
  - `pygame`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-rl.git
   cd snake-rl
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Game
To run the Snake game powered by Reinforcement Learning:
```bash
python agent.py
```

## How to Use
- Run the `agent.py` script to watch the Snake game in action.
- Initially, observe the snake moving randomly.
- As the training progresses, you'll see the snake making smarter decisions and efficiently eating the food.

## Project Structure
```
|-- agent.py       # RL Agent and game entry point
|-- game.py        # Game logic and environment
|-- helper.py      # Utility functions

## Future Improvements
- Enhancing the reward system for better learning efficiency.
- Adding a graphical interface to visualize the training progress.
- Experimenting with other reinforcement learning algorithms.
